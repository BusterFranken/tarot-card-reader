# 🎴 Buster's Tarot Card Reader - Setup Instructions

## What I Need From You

### 1. OpenAI API Key (REQUIRED)

The app uses OpenAI to generate tarot card interpretations. You need an API key.

#### Get Your API Key:
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. **Name it**: `tarot-card-reader`
5. **Copy the key** - it looks like: `sk-proj-...` (you won't see it again!)

#### Add It Locally:
Create a file named `.env.local` in the project root:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-actual-key-here
```

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Replace `sk-proj-your-actual-key-here` with your actual key!

## Running the App Locally

1. **Install dependencies** (if you haven't):
```bash
npm install
```

2. **Create `.env.local`** with your OpenAI key (see above)

3. **Start the development server**:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. **Open your browser** to http://localhost:3000

You should be automatically redirected to the tarot reading page!

## Testing the App

### Test Flow:
1. ✅ Enter a question (e.g., "What do I need to know about my career?")
2. ✅ Click "Begin Reading" - watch the shuffle animation
3. ✅ Hover over the Past card - it should lift slightly
4. ✅ Click the Past card - it flips over
5. ✅ Share what you see (or click "Skip")
6. ✅ Read the AI interpretation
7. ✅ Click "Continue to Present Card"
8. ✅ Repeat for Present and Future cards
9. ✅ Click "Get Combined Reading" for the final interpretation

### What to Check:
- Cards should flip when clicked
- AI should respond (not show errors)
- Each reading should reference previous cards
- Combined reading should weave all three together

## If You See Errors

### "OpenAI API key is missing or invalid"
- Check that `.env.local` exists in the root directory
- Verify the key starts with `sk-proj-` or `sk-`
- Make sure there are no spaces or quotes around the key
- Restart the dev server after creating `.env.local`

### "OpenAI API quota exceeded"
- Check your OpenAI billing at https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
- Add a payment method if needed
- Set usage limits to control costs

### Cards don't flip
- Check the browser console (F12) for errors
- Make sure images loaded properly
- Try refreshing the page
